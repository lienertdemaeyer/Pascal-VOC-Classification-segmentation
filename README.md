# Classification & Segmentation Pipeline with Adversarial Attacks on Pascal VOC

This repository contains a pipeline for performing both **classification** and **segmentation** tasks using deep learning models. Additionally, it implements adversarial attacks to test the robustness of the models on the Pascal VOC dataset.

## Overview
This project provides a modular approach for building and testing models for both classification and segmentation. The pipeline includes training, evaluation, and testing models, as well as generating adversarial examples using common attack techniques.

## Features
- **Classification & Segmentation Pipelines**: Train and evaluate models on the Pascal VOC dataset for image classification and segmentation tasks.
- **Adversarial Attacks**: Implementation of adversarial attacks such as FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method) and PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) to test model robustness.
- **Pascal VOC Dataset**: Pre-processing and loading of the Pascal VOC dataset for both tasks.
